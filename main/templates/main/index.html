<!-- 
    Main Portfolio Page
    
    This is the main template that assembles all sections of the portfolio website.
    It extends the base template and includes all major sections:
    
    1. Hero/Header - Landing area with name, photo, and introduction
    2. About - Personal information, skills, work history, and education
    3. Portfolio - Work samples and projects (currently WIP)
    4. Blogs - Blog posts and articles (currently placeholder content)
    5. Contact - Contact information and social media links
    
    The page uses a single-page application approach with smooth scrolling
    navigation between sections.

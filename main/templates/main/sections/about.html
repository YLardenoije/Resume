        <h4>Information About me</h4>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring software engineer that loves being excited about a project, and will get excited about many projects.
            I love the challenge of trying to figure out the puzzle before me and try my best to complete it in the best way possible.
            The result always makes me happy. I especially love it when I get the solution as simple as possible to explain and maintain.
        </p>

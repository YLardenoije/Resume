# One-Page Portfolio Layout

## Overview

The portfolio website has been converted from a single-page application (SPA) with hidden sections to a traditional one-page scrollable website where all sections are visible and accessible through natural scrolling.

## How It Works

### Navigation
- **Scroll naturally**: All sections are now visible and you can scroll through them normally
- **Navigation buttons**: Still functional - clicking them smoothly scrolls to the target section
- **Auto-highlighting**: Navigation buttons automatically highlight based on which section is currently in view

### Sections Layout
All sections are now stacked vertically in this order:
1. **Hero/Home** - Landing section with profile and introduction
2. **About** - Personal information, skills, work history, education
3. **Portfolio** - Work samples and projects
4. **Contact** - Contact information and social links

*Note: The blogs section is currently hidden but can be easily re-enabled by uncommenting it in the main template.*

## Technical Changes Made

### CSS Updates
- Changed sections from `position: absolute` to `position: relative`
- Removed `display: none` from `.container` class
- Added `scroll-behavior: smooth` for better user experience
- All sections now have `display: block` by default

### JavaScript Updates
- Navigation buttons now trigger `scrollIntoView()` instead of showing/hiding sections
- Added Intersection Observer API for automatic navigation highlighting during scroll
- Smooth scrolling behavior with proper timing

### Benefits
✅ **Natural Scrolling**: Users can scroll through content like a normal website  
✅ **Better SEO**: All content is visible to search engines  
✅ **Improved Accessibility**: Screen readers can navigate all content easily  
✅ **Mobile Friendly**: Touch scrolling works naturally on mobile devices  
✅ **Progressive Enhancement**: Navigation buttons still work for quick section jumping  

### User Experience
- **Scroll to explore**: Use mouse wheel, arrow keys, or touch gestures to scroll through sections
- **Quick navigation**: Click navigation buttons on the right for instant section jumping
- **Visual feedback**: Navigation highlights automatically update as you scroll
- **Smooth transitions**: All scrolling is smooth and pleasant

The website now provides both the convenience of quick navigation and the natural flow of a traditional scrollable page!
